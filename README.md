# Personal Trainer

intended to be a simple excersice tracking app to track w/e (workouts, cardio, etc), analytics piece (graphs are fun),
maybe integrate it with pebble or something similar using google maps api? Basically all the regualr full stack stuff, hopefully 
using some more clever front end technologies.

technologies:  
java 1.7  
tomcat 7 - web server  
maven 3 - dependency management  
Spring - container management/dependency injection/web framework  

todo:  
h2 - dev in memory database  
mysql - production database  
spock/groovy - testing  
polymer/angular/jquery/d3/crossfilter - front end  
bootrap - css? polymer may have better stuff  
logback - logging
